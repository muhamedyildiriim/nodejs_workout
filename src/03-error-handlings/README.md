# Error Handling — Overview

This section focuses on understanding, classifying, and managing errors in Node.js.
The goal is to learn **how to detect, categorize, propagate, and recover** from errors
in a way suitable for production applications.

## Structure
- `01-core-concepts/` — fundamentals of `Error` and built-in error types  
- `02-categories/` — programmer vs operational error types  
- `03-async-errors/` — callback, promise, and async/await failures  
- `04-propagation-recovery/` — passing errors between layers, recovery patterns  
- `05-express-integration/` — centralized error handling in Express apps

## How to Run
Each file includes a “Run” command in the header comment.  
Example:
```bash
node 03-async-errors/03-promise-rejections.js
```
