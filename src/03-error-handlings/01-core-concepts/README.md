# Core Concepts

**Goal:** Master the fundamentals of how JavaScript and Node.js create, throw, and classify errors.

This section builds the foundation for professional error handling —  
from basic `Error` objects to runtime, validation, and system-level issues.

## Key Takeaways
- Understand the anatomy of an `Error` (`name`, `message`, `stack`, `cause`)
- Distinguish between system, runtime, and validation errors
- Learn which errors to fix vs. which to handle gracefully
- Build consistent, production-grade error-handling habits

---

## Real-World Relevance
- Write code that **fails safely** instead of crashing
- Improve **debugging speed** and **log clarity**
- Demonstrate structured thinking and strong fundamentals —  
  the traits every U.S. engineering team values

## How to Run
Each example can be executed directly:
```bash
node path/to/file.js
```
Requires Node.js 20+ (ESM syntax)
